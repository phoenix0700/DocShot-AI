- Project creation: < 5 seconds
- Screenshot job queue: < 2 seconds
- Screenshot processing: < 60 seconds (depends on page complexity)

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test web app response times
curl -w "Total time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s https://your-app.vercel.app

# Test API endpoints
curl -w "API response: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Test worker health
curl -w "Worker response: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s https://your-worker.railway.app/health
```

### Load Testing (Optional)

**Basic Load Test:**
```bash
# Install Apache Bench
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install httpd                   # macOS

# Test 100 requests with 10 concurrent users
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://your-app.vercel.app/

## ðŸ”’ Security Testing

### Authentication Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Try to access dashboard without authentication
2. Verify redirect to login page
3. Test with invalid credentials
4. Test password reset flow (if applicable)

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- âœ… Invalid credentials are rejected
- âœ… Password reset works properly
- âœ… Session management works correctly

### Data Isolation Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Create two test users
2. Create projects for each user
3. Verify User A cannot see User B's projects
4. Test API endpoints with different user contexts

**Database Validation:**
```sql
-- Test RLS policies are working
-- This should return only the user's own projects
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = 'user_a_id';

-- This should fail or return empty for different user
SET app.current_user_id = 'user_b_id';
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = 'user_a_id';
```

### API Security Testing

**Test Steps:**
1. Try to access API endpoints without authentication
2. Test with invalid API keys (if applicable)
3. Verify rate limiting is working
4. Test CORS policies

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Protected endpoints require authentication
- âœ… Rate limiting prevents abuse
- âœ… CORS allows only expected origins
- âœ… Sensitive data is not exposed in responses

## ðŸ”— Integration Testing

### External Services

**Supabase Database:**
```bash
# Test connection
psql "postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres" -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user;"

# Test RLS policies
# (Should be done through application, not direct DB access in production)
```

**Upstash Redis:**
```bash
# Test Redis connection
redis-cli -u "rediss://default:[password]@[region]-[id].upstash.io:6380" ping

# Test queue operations
redis-cli -u "rediss://..." lpush test-queue "test-message"
redis-cli -u "rediss://..." rpop test-queue
```

**Cloudflare R2 Storage:**
```bash
# Test S3 operations
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com

# Test upload
echo "test" > test.txt
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://your-bucket/ --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com
aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket/test.txt --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

### GitHub Integration (if configured)

**Test Steps:**

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Alerts Testing

### Health Endpoints

**Web Application:**
```bash
# Should return 200 OK
curl -i https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"}
```

**Worker:**
```bash
# Should return health status
curl -i https://your-worker.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
#   "checks": {
#     "redis": "connected",
#     "database": "connected"
#   }
# }
```

### Error Handling

**Test Error Conditions:**
1. Submit invalid project data
2. Try to queue job with invalid screenshot ID
3. Test with network timeouts
4. Simulate database connection issues

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Errors are handled gracefully
- âœ… User-friendly error messages are shown
- âœ… System remains stable during errors
- âœ… Errors are logged for debugging

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Screenshot Jobs Failing

**Check:**
1. Worker logs: `railway logs` or platform logs
2. Redis queue status: Check for failed jobs
3. Puppeteer dependencies: Ensure Chrome is available
4. Network connectivity: Worker can reach target URLs

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check worker logs
railway logs --tail

# Check Redis queue
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL llen screenshot
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL llen screenshot:failed

# Test Puppeteer manually
node -e "const puppeteer = require('puppeteer'); puppeteer.launch().then(browser => { console.log('Puppeteer OK'); browser.close(); });"
```

### Database Connection Issues

**Check:**
1. Supabase project status
2. Connection string format
3. RLS policies are not blocking operations
4. Service role key permissions

**Debug Queries:**
```sql
-- Check connection limits
SELECT count(*) as active_connections 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Storage Upload Issues

**Check:**
1. S3/R2 bucket permissions
2. Access key credentials
3. CORS policies
4. Bucket region settings

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Test credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com

# List bucket contents
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com

# Test upload
echo "test" | aws s3 cp - s3://your-bucket/test.txt --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```
